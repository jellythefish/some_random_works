  3. Copy the url of chosen category.
  4. Run traektoria_parser.py script.
  5. Enter the copied URL.
  6. The result will be placed in database.txt in one folder with .py script.
  
  P.S. the database.txt consists of three columns divided with tab:
  - Category;
  - Name of the Good;
  - Price;
  - The total amount of goods in chosen category in the end of the list.
  
  Yep... :) For the love of any kind of boarding.
